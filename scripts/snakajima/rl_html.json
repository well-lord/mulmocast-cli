      "htmlPrompt": {
        "prompt": "Create a modern, professional title slide with the text 'Understanding Reinforcement Learning' in large, bold letters. Include a futuristic AI brain or neural network visualization in the background with blue and purple gradients. The design should be clean and academic."

      "text": "What is Reinforcement Learning? Imagine teaching a child to ride a bicycle. They try, fall, get back up, and try again. Each attempt teaches them something new. Reinforcement Learning works similarly - an agent learns to make decisions by receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.",
      "htmlPrompt": {
        "prompt": "Show a split-screen visualization: on the left, a simple illustration of a child learning to ride a bike with arrows showing the learning cycle. On the right, show an AI agent (represented as a robot or digital character) interacting with an environment, with reward signals (+1, -1) floating around."

    {
      "speaker": "Presenter",
      "text": "The core components of Reinforcement Learning are the Agent, Environment, Actions, States, and Rewards. The agent observes the current state, takes an action, and receives feedback from the environment in the form of a reward and a new state.",

        "prompt": "Create a clean diagram showing the RL loop: Agent connected to Environment with arrows labeled 'Action' going from Agent to Environment, and arrows labeled 'State' and 'Reward' going from Environment back to Agent. Use modern, minimalist design with clear icons for each component."

        "prompt": "Display a Q-table visualization showing states as rows and actions as columns, with numerical Q-values in each cell. Include a simple grid world example where an agent (represented as a blue dot) navigates to a goal (green square) while avoiding obstacles (red squares)."
